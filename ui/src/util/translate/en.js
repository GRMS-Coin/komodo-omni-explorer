Over the past year, we have measured the need for even more active movement in order to better support the KMD privacy mechanism. To implement this, the annual time limit on the growing of 5% will be changed to monthly cap of 5%/12 (0.417%). The good news is that compounding will get you rewards of 5.1% over a year. Your contribution to the privacy ecosystem will now be more closely linked to your reward. As this is a consensus rules change, it will need to activate at a future height and all existing utxos will still operate under the old rules, so this will only affect new utxo created after the activation height of 1 million."',
    MODAL_WHAT_THIS_MEANS: 'What This Means',
    MODAL_ALL_KMD_HOLDERS: 'All KMD holders need to begin actively collecting your KMD reward on a monthly basis to maximize your rewards for contributing to the activity of the KMD ecosystem. By collecting this reward monthly, users are actively contributing to the increase in privacy for everyone connected to the entire KMD protocol. As jl777 stated, there is a small bonus granted to those who collect the 0.417% reward every month in a year, resulting in a 5.1% annual reward. It is important to note that in order to gain the ability to be compounding this reward at all, users must still hold 10 or more KMD in their wallet.',
    MODAL_IN_SHORT: 'In short KMD holders (who hold 10 KMD or more in their Agama wallet) have the opportunity to actively participate in supporting Komodo\'s ecosystem, enhancing KMD\'s privacy feature and earn a reward for doing so.',
